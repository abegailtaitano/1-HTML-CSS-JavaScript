            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                I am 26 years old, I'm from a small island next to Guam called Saipan, but I moved to Las Vegas back in 2001.
                </li>
                <li>
                I am Chamorro, Filipino and Japanese.
                </li>
                <li>
                Currently I am not working, but I was a Visual Stylist for a furniture company called <a href="https://www.livingspaces.com/"> Living Spaces</a> and I loved it but I wanted something more challenging and new. I'm a very creative person and I have <em>sooo</em> many ideas that come to mind and I wanted to learn how to code and actually bring my ideas to life!
                </li>

<h2>Interests:</h2>
<section id="Interests:">
    <ul>
    <li>
    I love to work on my 4runner and finding new places to go off roading here in Las Vegas or anywhere else.
    </li>
    <li>
    I love all types of music but my favorite is EDM, I get my joy from being around people who are happy and dancing so festivals are the place to be where I find that joy the most :)
    </li>
    <li>However, other than EDM I do love reggae as well since it reminds me of being back home in the islands. </li>
        <li>Here is a song that my mom shared with me from the islands and you can also watch the video and see actual footage of my home Saipan:

        <li>
        Youtube is my <strong>weakness</strong> I can go on youtube and watch videos for hours, I love watching videos from singing competitions like American Idol to awesome videos of people doing crazy things around the world like in the GOPRO Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prt-G4cPIn4"> See for yourself :)</a>
